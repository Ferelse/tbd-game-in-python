# Blackjack Game in Python

This repository originally contained a simple snake game. It has been
replaced with a command-line Blackjack implementation written in pure
Python.

## Playing

Run `python blackjack.py` and follow the prompts to hit or stand. The
dealer draws until reaching a hand value of 17 or higher.
