# Blackjack Game in Python

This repository originally contained a simple snake game. It has been
replaced with a command-line Blackjack implementation written in pure
Python.

## Playing

Run `python blackjack.py` for the original command-line version. It
prompts you to hit or stand until the dealer reaches a hand value of 17
or higher.

If you prefer a windowed interface, run `python blackjack_gui.py` to
play using a simple pygame-based UI with clickable **Hit** and **Stand**
buttons.
